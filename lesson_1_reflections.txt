How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was good that, I was easily able to compare two different files and findout bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easily compare my files with any history and revert back those changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Pros - It would be easy for a developer to forget about commiting headache everytime
	Cons - You do not know what is the time interval, you want the git to keep commiting changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because all those multiple files may be related to each other, and saving them is a single logical change

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Its good that log will show the commits I have done on that file and diff will show the difference between those commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   Yes anytime I can go back to the working code and get the code working. Its that easy!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Its just awesome! I'll use it for all my projects
