When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

~ There is a possibilty that your sustem might crash! And when you want to share your code with others over the web
then its a good idea of creating repository reather than keeping local!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

~ Becuase there might be un-necessary changes that might keep pulling in all time.
