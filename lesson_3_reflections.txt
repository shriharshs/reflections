When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

~ There is a possibilty that your sustem might crash! And when you want to share your code with others over the web
then its a good idea of creating repository reather than keeping local!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

~ Becuase there might be un-necessary changes that might keep pulling in all time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
~ Fork - when you want to copy one repository in GitHub context, the FORK will be used
  Clone - When you want to copy your remote repository to local
  Braches - When you want to add new feature without disturbing the master
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
~ If you're offline then you can merge the changes locally and then push it with ease
